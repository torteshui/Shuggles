#  【秀】  [.Shuggles.] Store Info  【ツ】
----

Combined from my first name Shū (秀 - handsome) and Huggles, Shuggles embraces handsomeness
and beauty. In my store you will find carefully developed products, thoroughly tested scripts as
well as useful tools and scripts for creators and builders.

Main product is the mpHUD (Multi-purpose HUD) system. It provides versatile scripts to easily build
a HUD for shoes, mesh dresses, body parts like hair etc. - from simple color-changing or resizers
up to complex multi-sided HUDs with color picker, tabs, retexturing, resizing and walking sounds.

## CUSTOM SCRIPTING

I do custom scripting when I have time and charge L$ 2500 per hour for work that you have the
sole right to use (meaning I can't resell it) and L$ 500 per hour for work I keep the usage
rights on (meaning I can resell it for any price I deem appropriate). I reserve myself the right
to reuse common or general parts of the code in any case. Copyright on all code stays with me.

The same conditions apply for supporting work on others' scripts, but for small changes up to
20 minutes I charge only L$ 200. Small changes on my own scripts and of course fixes are free,
further changes are available for L$ 500 per hour.

The amount of time I need is agreed to before, based on your specification. Additional feature
requests need a new agreement. In case of an unclear specification, I keep the right to add missing
parts or not, depending on whether I really missed it or it was indeed not clearly stated by you.

These conditions might change, so please refer to the current version of this notecard which you
can find at the info terminal in the inworld store (see below).
