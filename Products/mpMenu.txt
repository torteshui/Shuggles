  【秀】  [.Shuggles.] Colorizer v0.59  【ツ】
============================================================

The Colorizer script can change the color and transparency on an object, linked prim or
face. On touch, it opens a menu letting you change the parameters. You can choose between
changing the whole object, the touched prim or only the touched face. Default prim and
face as well as additional faces can be configured in the script, the target selection
can be disabled. You can also specify that certain parameters are only to be applied to
specific prims (by name or link number) and faces.

There are several script variants with a different feature set. Please make sure you buy
the correct one:

- Colorizer: coloring
- Texturizer: texturing
- Sculptor: sculptmap changer
- Lighter: light changer
- Coverizer: all of the above and fullbright, glow, shininess

All parameters can be configured in a config notecard containing the word "mpMenuConfig"
somewhere in its name; a description and examples are included. If no config notecard can
be found, it uses a set of 32 predefined colors that can be changed in the script:

- white, light gray, gray, dark gray, black
- red, green, blue, yellow, magenta, cyan, orange, pink, purple (normal, bright, pastel)

On long touch (one second), it opens the options menu where you can select the access
level (all, group, owner) and reset the script.

Touch to open a menu can be configured to only work when no avatar is sitting on the
object. This makes it usable together with sitting scripts which only display a menu for
selecting poses if an avatar is seated.

If the object's name contains the word "DEMO", the script is usable by everyone, not just
the owner. Additionally, it displays a floating text using the object's description.

The Colorizer script is full perm. It's licensed under the BSD license with the addition
that it must not be resold or otherwise given away standalone in parts or as whole. It
can be used in your creations as long as these license conditions are met.
Please use the original scripts, keeping script name and creator intact, and remember to
change script permissions to copy or transfer only before you put your products on sale.

To update or redeliver a product, wear the included Updater and follow the instructions.

============================================================

The Lighter script can change the light color of an object or linked prim. On touch, it
opens a menu letting you change the parameters. You can choose between changing the whole
object, the touched prim or only the touched face. Default prim and face as well as
additional faces can be configured in the script, the target selection can be disabled.
You can also specify that certain parameters are only to be applied to specific prims
(by name or link number) and faces.

On long touch (one second), it opens the options menu where you can select the access
level (all, group, owner) and reset the script. Automatic glow, fullbright and coloring
depending on light status and color can also be enabled here. You can also configure the
script to enable light on touch (and the main menu on long touch).

============================================================
  【秀】  [.Shuggles.] Sculptor v0.59  【ツ】
============================================================

The Sculptor script can change the sculptmap on an object or linked prim. On touch, it
opens a menu letting you change the parameters. You can choose between changing the whole
object or only the touched prim. The default prim can be configured in the script, the
target selection can be disabled. You can also specify that certain parameters are only
to be applied to specific prims (by name or link number).

There are several script variants with a different feature set. Please make sure you buy
the correct one:

- Colorizer: coloring
- Texturizer: texturing
- Sculptor: sculptmap changer
- Lighter: light changer
- Coverizer: all of the above and fullbright, glow, shininess

All parameters can be configured in a config notecard containing the word "mpMenuConfig"
somewhere in its name; a description and examples are included. If no config notecard can
be found, sculptmaps are read from the object's inventory.

Texture names are automatically shortened to 24 characters. They should be no longer than
~14 characters so they can be displayed completely in the menu. If linked prims other
than the one the script is in shall be textured, the textures must be copy and transfer
due to an SL limitation.

Sculptmap texture names also need to start with "$" to be recognized as sculptmaps. This
can be changed by modifying the global constant SCULPT_PREFIX, however.

On long touch (one second), it opens the options menu where you can select the access
level (all, group, owner) and reset the script.

Touch to open a menu can be configured to only work when no avatar is sitting on the

___________________________________________________________________________

MANUAL (for all variants)

The simplest way to use the script is to put textures and the script into your object,
click on it, select whether you want to change the whole object, only the clicked prim or
face and then select from the provided options in the menu to change textures, colors,
lights, sculptmaps, fullbright, shininess and glow - depending on the actual script
variant. However, you can do a lot more by configuring the script or using a config
notecard.

To configure the script, please open it and change the following constants according to
your needs. Please note that not all options apply for all script variants:

ACCESS_LEVEL

Set the access level: 0 for all, 1 for group only, 2 for owner only. This can also be set
in the notecard and changed in the options menu later.

LISTENER_CHANNEL

Optional channel to send texture/color/light/sculptmap/fullbright/shiny/glow commands
to other objects which must contain the Skin Listener script (with the same configured
channel). If you use texture names, these textures must be in the other object. This
feature is marked as EXPERIMENTAL, so it might not work completely and could be changed
in future versions. Use -1 to disable.

Please note: You need to provide a prim (name or link number) of the other object for
this to work - or none to change the whole other object.

ALLOW_SITTING

TRUE to ignore if an avatar sits on the object, i.e. always open the menu on touch,
FALSE to do nothing when an avatar is sitting on an object.

TEXTURE_GIVER

TRUE to use a simple texture giver instead of texturing, FALSE otherwise. This can only
be used for the Texturizer script variant. Default is FALSE.

LONG_PRESS_MENU

TRUE to use long press (at least 1 second) to open menu, FALSE otherwise. This should
only be used for the Coverizer script variant, otherwise you might not be able to access
the options menu under certain conditions. Default is FALSE.

KEEP_MENU_OPEN

TRUE to keep menu open after a selection, FALSE otherwise. Default is TRUE.

USE_FULLBRIGHT

TRUE to have a Fullbright menu item, FALSE otherwise. Only applies for Coverizer.
Default is TRUE.

USE_SHINY

TRUE to have a Shiny menu item, FALSE otherwise. Only applies for Coverizer.
Default is TRUE.

USE_GLOW

TRUE to have a Glow menu item, FALSE otherwise. Only applies for Coverizer.
Default is TRUE.

AUTO_GLOW

TRUE to make light sources glow, FALSE otherwise. Only applies for Coverizer and Lighter.
Default is FALSE.

AUTO_BRIGHT

TRUE to make light sources fullbright, FALSE otherwise. Only applies for Coverizer and
Lighter. Default is FALSE.

AUTO_COLOR

TRUE to make light sources change their color to the light color, FALSE otherwise. Only
applies for Coverizer and Lighter. Default is FALSE.

CLICK_TO_LIGHT

TRUE to enable light by click on a face, FALSE otherwise. Only applies for Coverizer and
Lighter. This also requires LONG_PRESS_MENU. Default is FALSE.

TARGET_SELECTION

TRUE to show Object/Prim/Face selection, FALSE otherwise. This can be used with the
default prim or face. For single-prim objects with just one face, it is never displayed.
This can also be set in the notecard. Default is TRUE.

IGNORE_FACES

TRUE to ignore faces in target selection, FALSE otherwise. Default is TRUE for Sculptor
and Lighter, FALSE otherwise.

DEFAULT_FACE

Default prim[.face] to use, useful without target selection, use "" for whole object
(default), "root" for root prim, "touched" for touched prim and/or face, e.g.:

- "touched": touched prim
- "touched.2": face 2 of touched prim
- "touched.touched": touched face of touched prim
- "root.touched": touched face of any prim on root prim (not very useful)

ADDITIONAL_FACES

Additional faces to use, useful without target selection, use [] to disable.
Default is []. This is only needed for very special cases, so best leave it empty.

TEXTURE_PREFIX (only Coverizer, Texturizer and Sculptor)

Normal textures must start with this prefix - use "" for none. This can also be set in
the notecard. Default is "".

SCULPT_PREFIX (only Coverizer, Texturizer and Sculptor)

Sculptmap textures must start with this prefix - use "" for none. This can also be set in
the notecard. Default is "$".

TEXTURES, SCULPTMAPS, COLORS and COLOR_PAGES

Lists of default textures, sculptmaps (names or UUIDs) and colors. You can use them if no
config notecard is present. Textures and sculptmaps in inventory are ignored then. Please
specify them as name-value pairs. COLORS is used for colors and lights. Pages are for 9
name-value pairs each.

___________________________________________________________________________

CONFIG NOTECARD

All parameters can be configured in a config notecard containing the word "mpMenuConfig"
somewhere in its name. If no config notecard can be found, textures and sculptmaps are
read from the object's inventory and colors and lights use a set of 32 predefined colors.

- empty lines and comment lines starting with "#", "//" or "--" are ignored
- sections are enclosed in "[]"; possible sections: Textures, Sculptmaps, Colors, Lights
  - can contain an optional ":prim.face" definition
  - prim and face are the linked prim (name or link number) and optional face number
  - use "root" as prim name to specify root prim
  - values are only applied to the specified prim and face
  - if Prim or Face is selected in the menu, then only the touched prim or face are affected
  - best is to put these special sections into an own page and disable TARGET_SELECTION
- parameters are given as "name=value" pairs, separated by newline or "|"
  - be careful to use different names over all sections of the same type!
  - ":prim.face" can also be appended to single values
- texture and sculptmap values can be texture names (must be in inventory then) or UUIDs
  - ":prim.face" can also be appended to textures in inventory
- there are some symbolic texture names to set certain default textures:
  default, plywood, blank, transparent, media, null
- sculptmap values can also contain an additional sculpt type, separated by ","
  - if type is omitted, it is set to Sphere if the prim was no sculptie before
  - otherwise the type is not changed
  - if a sculptmap type is provided, it is set to the given value:
    1: Sphere, 2: Torus, 3: Plane, 4: Cylinder, add 64 to invert and 128 to mirror it
  - this also works when the sculptmap is read from inventory (without notecard)
  - if symbolic texture name null is used, the sculpted prim gets reset to a normal prim
- color and light values are in the form <R,G,B>,L or L,<R,G,B>
  - R, G and B values are the respective color channels and range from 0 to 255
  - L is the transparency or light level and toggled between L (0-100%) and opaque/off
  - color or level can be omitted (also the separator then)
- if a "Pages=page1|page2|..." option is present; "page1" etc. are used in the menu as
  heading for a group of 9 value pairs ("Pages" is case-insensitve)
- to fill pages with empty buttons, you can add "-=" or "-=-" as often as needed

  【秀】  [.Shuggles.] Resizer v0.59  【ツ】
============================================================

The Resizer script can resize an object and each linked prim separately, keeping the
object's shape or resizing each prim individually around its own center. On touch, it
opens a menu asking which part of the object you want to resize and then another one to
select the scaling factor and the stretch directions. With OK, you apply the new size,
with Cancel you restore it to the previous one. Using Pose, you can pose your avatar
without the need for a posing stand.

On long touch (one second), it opens the Options menu where you can select the access
level (all, group, owner) and reset or delete the script. With Store you can store the
current size, with Restore you reset it to the stored or original size.

Touch to open a menu can be configured to only work when no avatar is sitting on the
object. This makes it usable together with sitting scripts which only display a menu for
selecting poses if an avatar is seated. It works on rezzed objects and attachments and
keeps running on no script land.

The script checks upper and lower resize limits and also checks that prims in the linkset
never get too far apart. Since the distance check can be too restrictive, it can be
disabled.

Starting with this version, resize steps can be calculated from the size when opening
the menu (default) or the saved size, so increasing and decreasing by the same percentage
always leads to the same results without the need of special treatments. If necessary,
the legacy algorithm which uses the current size can still be used.

If the object's name contains the word "DEMO", the script is usable by everyone, not just
the owner. Additionally, it displays a floating text using the object's description.

The Resizer script is full perm. It's licensed under the BSD license with the addition
that it must not be resold or otherwise given away standalone in parts or as whole. It
can be used in your creations as long as these license conditions are met.
Please use the original scripts, keeping script name and creator intact, and remember to
change script permissions to copy or transfer only before you put your products on sale.

To update or redeliver a product, wear the included Updater and follow the instructions.
Store policies and info about custom scripting at my MP store and the inworld terminals.

___________________________________________________________________________

MANUAL

To configure the script, please open it and change the following constants according to
your needs:

ACCESS_LEVEL

Set the access level: 0 for all, 1 for group only, 2 for owner only. This can be changed
in the options menu later.

ALLOW_SITTING

TRUE to ignore if an avatar sits on the object, i.e. always open the menu on touch,
FALSE to do nothing when an avatar is sitting on an object.

TARGET_SELECTION

TRUE to show Object/Prim Relative/Prim Local selection, FALSE otherwise. This can be used
with the default prim and local. For single-prim objects, it is never displayed. Default
is TRUE.

DEFAULT_LINK

Default prim to use, useful without target selection, use LINK_SET for whole object,
0 for touched prim. Default is LINK_SET.

DEFAULT_LOCAL

Default flag to specify whether to use local resizing or not. TRUE to do a local resize
per prim, FALSE otherwise. Useful without target selection or for the whole object (which
otherwise always uses relative resizing for its prims).

RESIZE_METHOD

Starting with this version, resize steps can be calculated from the size when opening
the menu (default) or the saved size, so increasing and decreasing by the same percentage
always leads to the same results without the need of special treatments. If necessary,
the legacy algorithm which uses the current size can still be used.

Set to 0 to use legacy resize method (% of current size), to 1 for % of size when opening
menu, or to 2 for % of saved size. Default is 1.

Please note: The mpHUD system uses resize method 2.

DISTANCE_CHECK

The script checks upper and lower resize limits and also checks that prims in the linkset
never get too far apart. Since the distance check can be too restrictive, it can be
disabled. The exact way to do this by calculating the bounding sphere around all prim
centers and checking that its diameter is max. 54m is either non-trivial or inefficient,
so we just check if all prim centers stay within 27m of the root center. By putting the
root prim near the center of the linkset, this provides good results.

TRUE to check max. distance between prims to avoid breaking linkset (restrictive), FALSE
otherwise. Default is TRUE.

POSE_ANIM

Posing animation to use with the Pose button. It must be in the object's inventory or an
SL internal animation. Default is "turn_180" which is an internal animation and the same
as the one for Edit Appearance.

___________________________________________________________________________

RESIZE MENU

Click to get the resize menu:

- Object: resizes whole object
- Prim: resizes touched prim only
▣ Local: performs a local resize (around each prim's center)
- +1/+5/+10/-1/-5/-10: change size by given number (in percent)
▣ Stretch X: stretch in X direction
▣ Stretch Y: stretch in Y direction
▣ Stretch Z: stretch in Z direction
- OK: apply size and close menu
- CANCEL: revert size and close menu
▣ Pose: pose avatar

Click at least 1 second to get the options menu:

▣ All: everyone can access the menu
▣ Group: only group members and owner can access the menu
▣ Owner: only owner can access the menu
- Store: store current size, this will overwrite the previously stored size
- Restore: restore size to stored one
- Reset: reset the script, this will overwrite the stored size
- Delete: deletes the script
- CLOSE: closes the menu, obviously ^^

  【秀】  [.Shuggles.] Skin Applier v0.58  【ツ】
============================================================

The Skin Applier script can change an object's textures, materials, sculptmap, alpha mode,
colors, alpha, fullbright, bumpiness, shininess, glow, light and size. Texture names or
UUIDs as well as values for the other commands are configured in the script for linked
prims (by name) and face. For textures, normal maps and specular maps, texture repeat,
offset and rotation can be specified; if not, they stay unchanged. Fullbright can be set,
reset or toggled. Bumpiness, shininess, glow and light can be set, toggled or changed
relative to the current value. The size can be changed relatively with different factors
for each axis or absolutely. Examples are given in the script and two additional example
scripts. After everything has been applied when dropping the script in or on touch, the
script can be configured to delete itself.

It can e.g. be used as a simple applier for modifiable mesh avatars or body parts: just
drop the configured script inside - that's it. Creators can hand out ready-configured
scripts no mod, no trans to protect their texture UUIDs. An example template for the
Solarian mesh avatar is included.

Please note that toggle and relative changes only work for face 0 or all faces currently
because face 0 is used to get the current value. For normal and specular maps, the face
needs to be given if only the texture is specified, otherwise only face 0 is changed.

The Skin Applier script is full perm. It's licensed under the BSD license with the
addition that it must not be resold or otherwise given away standalone in parts or as
whole. It can be used in your creations as long as these license conditions are met.
You are allowed to sell the renamed edited script with your changes under your name.
Please remember to change script permissions to copy or transfer only before you put
your products on sale.

To update or redeliver a product, wear the included Updater and follow the instructions.
Store policies and info about custom scripting at my MP store and the inworld terminals.

___________________________________________________________________________

MANUAL

Please configure the script by changing the following constants and rename the linked
prims in the object to put them into different prim groups that can be changed together.
In the simplest case, group names are just the existing prim names. Then you can use the
script to change the object you are putting it into. You can also hand out configured
scripts no mod, no trans to your customers, e.g. as a simple applier for modifiable mesh
avatars or body parts. Your customers only need to drop the script e.g. in their avatar
and it changes the skin.

APPLY_ON_START

Set to TRUE to apply parameters on script start, FALSE if not. This should be set for an
applier you are handing out to your customers, so they only have to drop the script into
their mesh avatar or body part. Default is FALSE.

APPLY_ON_TOUCH

Set to TRUE to apply parameters on touch, FALSE if not. Default is TRUE.

AUTO_DELETE

Set to TRUE to automatically delete script afterwards, FALSE if not. This should be set
for an applier you are handing out to your customers, so the script doesn't stay in their
mesh avatar or body part. Default is FALSE.

USE_TOUCHED_PRIM

Set to TRUE to only change touched prim, FALSE if not. This can be set e.g. to change
different lights in one object consisting of different prims that are used as light
sources (see example below). Default is FALSE.

SKIN_PARAMS

Remove the examples and add your own commands instead. The syntax is described in the
script and also here. Empty lines and comment lines starting with "#", "//" or "--"
are ignored.

Command syntax:

Texture:group[.face]|texture,repeat,offset,rotation
Normal:group[.face]|texture,repeat,offset,rotation
Specular:group[.face]|texture,repeat,offset,rotation,color,gloss,env
Sculpt:group|texture[,type] or
Sculptmap:group|texture[,type] or
Map:group|texture[,type]
AlphaMode:group[.face]|mode[,cutoff]
Color:group[.face]|color
Alpha:group[.face]|[[+/-]value]
Fullbright:group[.face]|[value]
Bump:group[.face]|[[+/-]mode]
Shiny:group[.face]|[[+/-]level]
Glow:group[.face]|[[+/-]level]
Light:group|[[+/-]level[,color]] or
Light:group|[color[,[+/-]level]]
SetSize:group|size[L]
SetScale:group|scale[L]

Please note that the parameters are separated by comma, separating them by ":" is not
supported anymore! Please change your scripts accordingly. Size and Scale commands have
been renamed to SetSize and SetScale; the former are still supported, but deprecated.
From v0.56 on, group names are case-insensitive. From v0.57 on, SKIN_PARAMS is a string
and not a list anymore. This should make it easier to use your commands.

Groups are optional now; if you omit them, the whole object is changed. You still need to
provide the colon after the command! You can also use the special group "root" to change
the root prim only. If you prepend the command by "-", error messages are supressed.

Please also note that changing the size does not work for rigged mesh attachments.

Parameters:

- group: case-insensitive name of a group of linked prims to change (prims with same name belong to one group)
         can be empty for whole object (but keep the colon), use "root" for root prim
- face: face number or empty for all sides
- texture: name or UUID, must be copy and transfer or a UUID
- there are some symbolic texture names to set certain default textures:
  default, plywood, blank, transparent, media, null
- texture repeat: use <1, 1, 0> for no repeat, omit to leave values unchanged
- texture offset: use <0, 0, 0> for no offset
- texture rotation: in degrees, use 0 for no rotation
- specular color: use <R, G, B>, ranging from 0 to 255 each
- specular gloss: glossiness exponent, in the range 0 to 255
- specular env: environmental reflection exponent, in the range 0 to 255
- sculptmap type: 1=Sphere, 2=Torus, 3=Plane, 4=Cylinder, +64 to invert, +128 to mirror
- alpha mode: use 0-3 (None, Blend, Mask, Emissive)
- alpha mode cutoff: use 0-100 (%) for transparency (0 is opaque) to become transparent when using mode 2 (Mask)
- color: use <R, G, B>, ranging from 0 to 255 each
- alpha: use 0-100 (%) transparency (like in edit dialog), omit to toggle, use sign for relative changes
- fullbright value: use 1 to switch on, 0 to switch off, omit to toggle
- bumpiness mode: use 0-17, omit to toggle, use sign for relative changes
- shininess level: use 0-3 (Off, Low, Medium and High), omit to toggle, use sign for relative changes
- glow level: use 0-100 (%), omit to toggle between 10% and 0%, use sign for relative changes
- light level: use 0-100 (%), omit to toggle between 100% and 0%, use sign for relative changes
- light color: use <R, G, B>, ranging from 0 to 255 each, omit to leave unchanged
- size: use <X, Y, Z> for the new size, add "L" to resize locally (around the prim's center instead of the object's)
- scale: use <X, Y, Z> for the scale factor the current size is multiplied with, add "L" to resize locally

If you are using Second Life prior to 3.7.26 (299610) or any TPV using its older code,
please note: Your diffuse textures (Texture button) should contain an alpha channel when
using materials. Reason is an issue with the alpha mode which needs to be set correctly.
Usually the viewer does it when the texture is set manually, but if a script sets it, the
alpha mode is not changed to the correct one. If you want to use diffuse textures without
alpha channel, you have to prepare the object to use alpha mode "None" in the edit dialog.
To change it, you have to temporarily apply a texture with alpha channel, otherwise it
stays grayed out. Afterwards, you can set your correct texture. In newer viewers, this
issue is fixed; alpha mode "Blend" also works with textures without alpha channel now.

============================================================
  【秀】  [.Shuggles.] Skin Listener v0.58  【ツ】
============================================================

The Skin Listener script can change an object's textures, materials, alpha mode,
sculptmaps, colors, alpha, fullbright, bumpiness, shininess, glow, light and size. It
listens on a configurable channel (in the script) for certain commands (from owner or
their objects only - or everyone if configured). These commands contain texture names or
UUIDs as well as values for the other commands for linked prims (by name) and face. For
textures, normal maps and specular maps, texture repeat, offset and rotation can be
specified; if not, they stay unchanged. Fullbright can be set, reset or toggled.
Bumpiness, shininess, glow and light can be set, toggled or changed relative to the
current value. The size can be changed relatively with different factors for each axis
or absolutely. Examples are provided.

You can configure these commands in gestures and also mix them with animations, sounds,
delays and normal chats. This way you can enhance gestures with also affecting the look
of your avatar or rezzed objects. For instance, use an angry face as trigger to turn
your eyes first yellow, then red or use a <3 to put little hearts in your eyes (only
works with modifiable attachments, e.g. mesh avatars, and rezzed objects). An example
gesture is provided; just rez a simple cube, name it "0" (without the quotes), drop the
script inside and use the gesture.

The script also sends a request command when the object is rezzed. This can be used to
let another object issue commands to change the rezzed object. A simple example server
script that sets the color of another object's child prims depending on the name of its
root prim and color of the server (child) prim is included. In case you want to use this
feature, you need to adapt the server script to your needs. If you are unsure about it,
you probably don't need it.

Before using the script in your creations, please change the channel in it. To do that,
just open the script and change the constant CHANNEL to the channel you prefer.

Please note that toggle and relative changes only work for face 0 or all faces currently
because face 0 is used to get the current value. For normal and specular maps, the face
needs to be given if only the texture is specified, otherwise only face 0 is changed.

The Skin Listener script is full perm. It's licensed under the BSD license with the
addition that it must not be resold or otherwise given away standalone in parts or as
whole. It can be used in your creations as long as these license conditions are met.
Please use the original scripts, keeping script name and creator intact, and remember to
change script permissions to copy or transfer only before you put your products on sale.

To update or redeliver a product, wear the included Updater and follow the instructions.

___________________________________________________________________________

MANUAL

Please put the script in the object you want to change, rename the linked prims in the
object to put them into different prim groups that can be changed together. In the
simplest case, group names are just the existing prim names. Then create gestures to
send the following commands in chat. Of course you can also send them by other means,
as long as they come from the owner or their objects. A simple example server script is
included which sends commands after being contacted when the object that contains the
Skin Listener script is rezzed.

Command syntax:

/channel skin.texture:group[.face]|texture,repeat,offset,rotation
/channel skin.normal:group[.face]|texture,repeat,offset,rotation
/channel skin.specular:group[.face]|texture,repeat,offset,rotation,color,gloss,env
/channel skin.sculpt:group|texture[,type] or
/channel skin.sculptmap:group|texture[,type] or
/channel skin.map:group|texture[,type]
/channel skin.alphamode:group[.face]|mode[,cutoff]
/channel skin.color:group[.face]|color
/channel skin.alpha:group[.face]|[[+/-]value]
/channel skin.fullbright:group[.face]|[value]
/channel skin.bump:group[.face]|[[+/-]mode]
/channel skin.shiny:group[.face]|[[+/-]level]
/channel skin.glow:group[.face]|[[+/-]level]
/channel skin.light:group|[[+/-]level[,color]] or
/channel skin.light:group|[color[,[+/-]level]]
/channel skin.setsize:group|size[L]
/channel skin.setscale:group|scale[L]

Please note that the parameters are separated by comma, separating them by ":" is not
supported anymore! Please change your scripts accordingly. Size and Scale commands have
been renamed to SetSize and SetScale; the former are still supported, but deprecated.
From v0.56 on, group names are case-insensitive.

Groups are optional now; if you omit them, the whole object is changed. You still need to
provide the colon after the command! You can also use the special group "root" to change
the root prim only. If you prepend the command by "-", error messages are supressed.

Please also note that changing the size does not work for rigged mesh attachments.

Parameters:

- channel: the channel you need to define in the script
- group: case-insensitive name of a group of linked prims to change (prims with same name belong to one group)
         can be empty for whole object (but keep the colon), use "root" for root prim
- face: face number or empty for all sides
- texture: name or UUID, must be copy and transfer or a UUID
- there are some symbolic texture names to set certain default textures:
  default, plywood, blank, transparent, media, null
- texture repeat: use <1, 1, 0> for no repeat, omit to leave values unchanged
- texture offset: use <0, 0, 0> for no offset
- texture rotation: in degrees, use 0 for no rotation
- specular color: use <R, G, B>, ranging from 0 to 255 each
- specular gloss: glossiness exponent, in the range 0 to 255
- specular env: environmental reflection exponent, in the range 0 to 255
- sculptmap type: 1=Sphere, 2=Torus, 3=Plane, 4=Cylinder, +64 to invert, +128 to mirror
- alpha mode: use 0-3 (None, Blend, Mask, Emissive)
- alpha mode cutoff: use 0-100 (%) for transparency (0 is opaque) to become transparent when using mode 2 (Mask)
- color: use <R, G, B>, ranging from 0 to 255 each
- alpha: use 0-100 (%) transparency (like in edit dialog), omit to toggle, use sign for relative changes
- fullbright value: use 1 to switch on, 0 to switch off, omit to toggle
- bumpiness mode: use 0-17, omit to toggle, use sign for relative changes
- shininess level: use 0-3 (Off, Low, Medium and High), omit to toggle, use sign for relative changes
- glow level: use 0-100 (%), omit to toggle between 10% and 0%, use sign for relative changes
- light level: use 0-100 (%), omit to toggle between 100% and 0%, use sign for relative changes
- light color: use <R, G, B>, ranging from 0 to 255 each, omit to leave unchanged
- size: use <X, Y, Z> for the new size, add "L" to resize locally (around the prim's center instead of the object's)
- scale: use <X, Y, Z> for the scale factor the current size is multiplied with, add "L" to resize locally

If you are using Second Life prior to 3.7.26 (299610) or any TPV using its older code,
please note: Your diffuse textures (Texture button) should contain an alpha channel when
using materials. Reason is an issue with the alpha mode which needs to be set correctly.
Usually the viewer does it when the texture is set manually, but if a script sets it, the
alpha mode is not changed to the correct one. If you want to use diffuse textures without
alpha channel, you have to prepare the object to use alpha mode "None" in the edit dialog.
To change it, you have to temporarily apply a texture with alpha channel, otherwise it
stays grayed out. Afterwards, you can set your correct texture. In newer viewers, this
issue is fixed; alpha mode "Blend" also works with textures without alpha channel now.
