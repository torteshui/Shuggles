  【秀】  [.Shuggles.] Adboard v1.59  【ツ】
============================================================

The Adboard v1 offers you the possibility to display an ad that is divided into eight
parts, so you can have large ad displays without losing image resolution. You can display
different ads with the same Adboard. Faces can be defined that load the next or previous
ad or open a menu when clicked on. An automatic timer can be configured. You can also
select between different transition and fading effects:

- only one part at a time
- all parts at the same time in parallel
- all parts at the same time, one after another
- all parts at the same time, all faded out, then all new ones faded in
- fading to black, color or transparent, scaling up and down, rotating, glowing, none or random

The Adboard uses the Slideshow and Config Handler scripts. Configuration is done in
a config notecard containing the word "Slideshow" in its name (example and manual
included).

The object is full mesh and only 1 prim at any size and it requires a mesh-compatible
viewer. It's copy/mod/no-trans, so you can modify it, e.g. to change the size.
I suggest making a copy before you modify it, just in case.

To update or redeliver a product, wear the included Updater and follow the instructions.

MANUAL

For the slideshow, you need to either add your pictures to the inventory of the object
and add their names to the config notecard (it's important that they are in the inventory
as well) - or their UUIDs (they don't need to be in the inventory then). You can get the
UUID by right-clicking on the texture and select "Copy Asset UUID". Other textures in the
inventory are ignored when using a config notecard.

You need to configure which pictures get displayed on which linked prim and which of its
faces (see below). You can use prim names or link numbers which start with 1 (root prim)
for objects with more than one prim, or it is 0 for single prim objects. Face numbers
start with 0. The faces for the pictures range from 0 to 7 (top left to bottom right).

You can set the operation modes (auto timers, direction, touch mode, transitions and
fading mode) either in the object's description or in the config notecard (see below).
When using the menu, you can change (almost) everything there as well:

+ IMAGE SETS: opens submenu to change the image set, use MAIN to return
+ IMAGES: opens submenu to change the displayed image, use MAIN to return
+ TOUCH MODE: opens submenu to change the touch mode, use MAIN to return
  ▣ Click: image transition on click (none is when all are deselected)
  ▣ Slide: image transition on slide left and right
+ TRANSITION: opens submenu to change image transition, use MAIN to return
  ▣ Forward:  click goes to next image
  ▣ Reverse:  click goes to previous image
  ▣ Random:   random or put current image on Main face
  ▣ One:      change only one image
  ▣ Parallel: change all at the same time
  ▣ Serial:   change one after another
  ▣ Sequential: all are faded out, then all new faded in
  ▣ Auto:     set auto timer from a list of preconfigured values (see config)
+ FADE MODE: opens submenu to change the fade mode, use MAIN to return
  ▣ Random:  randomly select one of the following (none is when all are deselected)
  ▣ Black:   fade to black
  ▣ Trans:   fade to transparent
  ▣ Scale:   scale up
  ▣ Enlarge: scale up around the center
  ▣ Reduce:  scale down around the center
  ▣ Rotate:  rotate
  ▣ Left:    slide left
  ▣ Right:   slide left
  ▣ Glow:    glowing effect
  ▣ Color:   fade to (darker) color (value can only be set in config)
- Restart: restart image set from the beginning
- Reload:  reload config and restart
- Reset:   reset the script
+ ACCESS: opens submenu to change the access level, use MAIN to return
  ▣ All:   everyone can access the slideshow
  ▣ Group: only group members and owner can access the slideshow
  ▣ Owner: only owner can access the slideshow
- CLOSE: closes the menu, obviously ^^

You should change the level of detail (LOD) to at least 4. To do so, enable the Advanced
menu in the Advanced Preferences, then open it and go to Show Debug Settings. Browse for
RenderVolumeLODFactor and set it to 4.

  【秀】  [.Shuggles.] Slideshow Frames v1.59  【ツ】
============================================================

You can fill the Slideshow Frames with 7 images of your choice, e.g. pictures of your
dearest friends, nice photographs, your pets or anything else you can imagine. A menu
allows you to change frame textures, color, shininess, fullbright, glow effect and
lighting in different colors. And you can add your own frame textures; a supporting full
perm ambient occlusion map is included in the object.

Many parameters can be configured in a config notecard; a description and an example are
included. If no config notecard can be found, textures have to start with "[]" and are
read from the object's inventory, colors and lights use a set of 32 predefined colors:

- white, light gray, gray, dark gray, black
- red, green, blue, yellow, magenta, cyan, orange, pink, purple (normal, bright, pastel)

Texture names are automatically shortened to 24 characters. They should be no longer than
~14 characters so they can be displayed completely in the menu. If linked prims other
than the one the script is in shall be textured, the textures must be copy and transfer
due to an SL limitation.

This bundle includes the Slideshow and Config Handler scripts. They allow you to have a
configurable slideshow of your pictures. They can be changed by clicking or sliding them
to the left and the right for getting the next or the previous image. By clicking on the
picture frames, a second menu allows you to change the slideshow parameters that were
defined in a slideshow config notecard. An automatic timer can be set as well. You can
also select between different transition and fading effects:

- only one image at a time
- all images at the same time in parallel
- all images at the same time, one after another
- all images at the same time, all faded out, then all new ones faded in
- fading to black, color or transparent, scaling up and down, rotating, glowing, none or random

The object is full mesh and only 1 prim at the sold size and it requires a mesh-
compatible viewer. It's copy/mod/no-trans, so you can modify it, e.g. to change the size.
Included are prescaled 1:1, 4:3 and 16:9 formats, but you can also resize them, although
not individually! Please be aware that resizing also changes the width of the frames on
the scaled axis. I suggest making a copy before you modify them, just in case.

To update or redeliver a product, wear the included Updater and follow the instructions.

to the left and the right for getting the next or the previous image. By clicking on the
picture frames, a second menu allows you to change the slideshow parameters that were
defined in a slideshow config notecard. An automatic timer can be set as well. You can
also select between different transition and fading effects:

- only one image at a time
- all images at the same time in parallel
- all images at the same time, one after another
- all images at the same time, all faded out, then all new ones faded in
- fading to black, color or transparent, scaling up and down, rotating, glowing, none or random

The object is full mesh and only 1 prim at the sold size and it requires a mesh-
compatible viewer. It's copy/mod/no-trans, so you can modify it, e.g. to change the size.
Included are prescaled 1:1, 4:3 and 16:9 formats, but you can also resize them, although
not individually! Please be aware that resizing also changes the width of the frames on
the scaled axis. I suggest making a copy before you modify them, just in case.

To update or redeliver a product, wear the included Updater and follow the instructions.

For creators:

If you want to add your own textures, you can save the included ambient occlusion map
(texture "[] Ambient" in the object) to your computer and multiply the texture you want
to add to it, then upload the resulting picture and just add it to the object. Textures
have to start with "[]" if no config notecard is used. You may also sell self-created
texture packs if you want, I just ask you to add a reference to the original product and
creator.

OBJECT CONFIG NOTECARD

Object textures, colors and light colors can be configured in a notecard that contains
the string "mpMenuConfig" somewhere in its name. If none can be found, textures have to
start with "[]" and are read from the object's inventory, colors and lights use a set of
32 predefined colors.

SLIDESHOW CONFIG NOTECARD AND OBJECT DESCRIPTION

The slideshow is configured in a config notecard containing the word "Slideshow" in its
name. You need to either add your pictures to the inventory of the object and add the
names to the slideshow config notecard (it's important that they are in the inventory as
well) - or their UUIDs (they don't need to be in the inventory then). You can get the
UUID by right-clicking on the texture and select "Copy Asset UUID". Other textures in the
inventory are ignored.

You need to configure which pictures get displayed on which linked prim and which of its
faces (see below). You can use prim names or link numbers which start with 1 (root prim)
for objects with more than one prim, or it is 0 for single prim objects. Face numbers
start with 0. The faces for the pictures range from 1 to 7 (top left to bottom right).

You can set the operation modes (auto timers, direction, touch mode, transitions and
fading mode) either in the object's description or in the config notecard (see below).
When using the menu, you can change (almost) everything there as well.

----------------------------------------------------------------
# Example
Menu=root.0|Auto=20,40,60,0|Dir=1|Touch=Slide|Transit=Ser|Fade=Black|Access=All
[Textures:prim.face]
Image 1
Image 2
UUID 1
...
[Textures:prim.face]
Image 3
UUID 2
...
----------------------------------------------------------------

- empty lines and comment lines starting with "#", "//" or "--" are ignored
- Textures sections are enclosed in "[]", they define each face used for displaying images
  (DEPRECATED: omitting the colon or replacing it by a space, REMOVED: using Face instead of Textures)
- image names and UUIDs are separated by newline or "|", please omit a trailing "|"
- prim and face are the linked prim (name or link number, use "root" for root prim) and face number
- Menu face is used to open the menu to select image sets and options
- Auto timers are given in seconds (include 0 to allow switching it off)
- Dir defines the direction of the images:
  -  1: next image
  - -1: previous image
  -  0: random
- Touch defines the touch mode:
  - None:  useful with Auto timer
  - Click: next image on click
  - Slide: slide left and right
- Transit defines the transition mode of the images:
  - One: only one image
  - Par: all at the same time
  - Ser: one after another
  - Seq: all are faded out, then all new faded in
- Fade defines the fading mode of the images:
  - None
  - Random:  randomly select one of the following
  - Black:   fade to black
  - Trans:   fade to transparent
  - Scale:   scale up
  - Enlarge: scale up around the center
  - Reduce:  scale down around the center
  - Rotate:  rotate
  - Left:    slide left
  - Right:   slide right
  - Glow:    glowing effect
  - <R,G,B>: fade to (darker) color, RGB each range from 0 to 255 (can't be changed by menu)
  - Scale, Enlarge, Reduce, Rotate, Left and Right only work well with Transit modes One and Ser
- Access defines the access level (Owner, Group or All)

The options can also be set in the object's description field (you only need to specify
those you want to set and all in one line, of course):

----------------------------------------------------------------
Config:Menu=root.0:Auto=20,40,60,0:Dir=1:Touch=Slide:Transit=Ser:Fade=Black:Access=All
----------------------------------------------------------------

Please note: When you change the description field, you need to reset the script
afterwards before the new values are read.


============================================================
  【秀】  [.Shuggles.] Picture Frames v1.59  【ツ】
============================================================

You can fill the Picture Frames with 7 images of your choice, e.g. pictures of your
dearest friends, nice photographs, your pets or anything else you can imagine. A menu
allows you to change frame textures, color, shininess, fullbright, glow effect and
lighting in different colors. And you can add your own frame textures; a supporting full
perm ambient occlusion map is included in the object.

Many parameters can be configured in a config notecard; a description and an example are
included. If no config notecard can be found, textures have to start with "[]" and are
read from the object's inventory, colors and lights use a set of 32 predefined colors:

- white, light gray, gray, dark gray, black
- red, green, blue, yellow, magenta, cyan, orange, pink, purple (normal, bright, pastel)

Texture names are automatically shortened to 24 characters. They should be no longer than
~14 characters so they can be displayed completely in the menu. If linked prims other
than the one the script is in shall be textured, the textures must be copy and transfer
due to an SL limitation.

The object is full mesh and only 1 prim at the sold size and it requires a mesh-
compatible viewer. It's copy/mod/no-trans, so you can modify it, e.g. to change the size.
Included are prescaled 1:1, 4:3 and 16:9 formats, but you can also resize them, although
not individually! Please be aware that resizing also changes the width of the frames on
the scaled axis. I suggest making a copy before you modify them, just in case.

When 2 of the frame sets are linked together, they still are only 1 prim - for 14
pictures! Especially useful if you need to take care of your prims. Since the script and
all textures need to be removed from the child prim then and that might not be so easy to
do for everyone, the 14 picture version for the 1:1 format is already included. You may
resize each set individually (also to get the 4:3 and 16:9 formats), but doing so might
get the linked object above 1 prim, depending on the size.

To update or redeliver a product, wear the included Updater and follow the instructions.

  【秀】  [.Shuggles.] Fretwork Frame v1.59  【ツ】
============================================================

The Fretwork Frame displays a nice 3D fretwork in a picture frame with a modifiable
background image and text message (by manually changing textures). This one comes with a
snowmen fretwork and a winter scene background. A menu allows you to change the fretwork
texture, color, shininess, fullbright, glow effect and lighting in different colors. And
you can add your own fretwork textures; a supporting full perm ambient occlusion map is
included in the object.

Many parameters can be configured in a config notecard; a description and an example
are included. If no config notecard can be found, textures are read from the object's
inventory, colors and lights use a set of 32 predefined colors:

- white, light gray, gray, dark gray, black
- red, green, blue, yellow, magenta, cyan, orange, pink, purple (normal, bright, pastel)

Texture names are automatically shortened to 24 characters. They should be no longer than
~14 characters so they can be displayed completely in the menu. If linked prims other
than the one the script is in shall be textured, the textures must be copy and transfer
due to an SL limitation.

The object is full mesh and only 2 prims at the sold size and it requires a mesh-
compatible viewer. It's copy/mod/no-trans, so you can modify it, e.g. to change the size.
I suggest making a copy before you modify them, just in case.

Slideshow script to have a nice slideshow in the background.

You should change the level of detail (LOD) to at least 4. To do so, enable the Advanced
menu in the Advanced Preferences, then open it and go to Show Debug Settings. Browse for
RenderVolumeLODFactor and set it to 4.

For creators:

If you want to add your own textures, you can save the included ambient occlusion map
(texture "Ambient" in the object) to your computer and multiply the texture you want to
add to it, then upload the resulting picture and just add it to the object. You may also
sell self-created texture packs if you want, I just ask you to add a reference to the
original product and creator.

  【秀】  [.Shuggles.] Colorable Shelf v1.59  【ツ】
============================================================

The Colorable Shelf is a piece of furniture for your house or apartment, or for
presenting your products in a store. A menu allows you to change textures, color,
shininess, fullbright, glow effect and lighting in different colors. And you can add
your own textures; a supporting full perm ambient occlusion map is included in the object.

Many parameters can be configured in a config notecard; a description and an example are
included. If no config notecard can be found, textures have to start with "#" and are
read from the object's inventory, colors and lights use a set of 32 predefined colors:

- white, light gray, gray, dark gray, black
- red, green, blue, yellow, magenta, cyan, orange, pink, purple (normal, bright, pastel)

Texture names are automatically shortened to 24 characters. They should be no longer than
~14 characters so they can be displayed completely in the menu. If linked prims other
than the one the script is in shall be textured, the textures must be copy and transfer
due to an SL limitation. The shelves contain 2 textures each.

The object is full mesh and only 3 prims at the sold size and it requires a mesh-
compatible viewer. It is copy/mod/no-trans, so you can modify it, e.g. to change the
size. I suggest making a copy before you modify it, just in case. Two versions are
included: with and without gaps between the individual parts.

To update or redeliver a product, wear the included Updater and follow the instructions.

  【秀】  [.Shuggles.] Nixie Clock v1.51  【ツ】
============================================================

An RL Nixie Clock is made of several Nixie tubes (cold cathode displays), an electronic
device for displaying numerals or other information using glow discharge. The glass tube
contains a wire-mesh anode and multiple cathodes, shaped like numerals or other symbols.
Applying power to one cathode surrounds it with an orange glow discharge. The tube is
filled with a gas at low pressure, usually mostly neon and often a little mercury or
argon, in a Penning mixture.

Although it resembles a vacuum tube in appearance, its operation does not depend on
thermionic emission of electrons from a heated cathode. It is therefore called a cold-
cathode tube (a form of gas-filled tube), or a variant of neon lamp. Such tubes rarely
exceed 40 °C (104 °F) even under the most severe of operating conditions in a room at
ambient temperature. Vacuum fluorescent displays from the same era use completely
different technology—they have a heated cathode together with a control grid and shaped
phosphor anodes; Nixies have no heater or control grid, typically a single anode, and
shaped bare metal cathodes. [quoted from Wikipedia]

This SL version of a Nixie Clock is made of several prims (land impact 21) for the tubes
and the body. It displays the time and (at seconds 55-59) the current date in GMT. The
timezone can be set in half-hour steps by a menu which opens on touch, so the clock then
displays your local time and date.

The object is copy/mod/no-trans, so you can modify it, e.g. to change the size or colors.
After being rezzed and taken again, it displays as no-mod in your inventory because of
the script inside. You can still modify it when rezzing it again, but just in case, I
suggest making a copy before you rez or modify it.

  【秀】  [.Shuggles.] Sticker HUD v1.56  【ツ】
============================================================

The Sticker HUD offers you the possibility to send stickers to your friends who also
own the HUD or to display them in a speech bubble next to your head. It uses textures
(sticker packs) that contain several stickers and are read from the HUD's inventory or
(as UUIDs) from a configuration notecard. If someone sends you a sticker, it plays a
configurable notification sound and the sticker pack gets automatically added to the
list of your sticker packs. Three sticker packs are already included in the provided
configuration notecard inside the HUD. If a sound is found in the HUD's inventory, it
is used as notification sound (overwriting the default sound), unless overwritten itself
by the sound configuration in the config notecard.

To use the Sticker HUD, just attach it to your HUD area on bottom center. The interface
consists of several buttons, a preview field and a HUD bubble. If you want to display
stickers next to your head (in a mood bubble), please attach the Sticker Bubble as well.

The buttons from left to right are:

- previous sticker pack
- open sticker pack selection menu
- show preview area or minimize
- send previewed sticker to mood bubble or hide mood bubble before timeout
- toggle hold status that makes the mood bubble stay
- send previewed sticker to another avatar within scan range
- open options menu
- next sticker pack

You can configure the following in the options menu:

- access level all, group only, owner only or list of authorized avatars
- add and remove avatars by username to list of authorized avatars
- list uses case insensitive usernames (first.last) or legacy names
- only allowed avatars can send you a sticker
- sticker timeout, scan range for avatars, sticker bubble size factor
- option to clear list of received stickers
- option to reset script

Received stickers and sender name appear in the HUD bubble. To hide them again, just
click the bubble. When the HUD minimizes by button press or after timeout, the bubble
also fades out.

The Sticker HUD and the Sticker Bubble are copy/mod/no-trans, so you can modify them,
e.g. to change the size of the HUD, add new sticker packs or change the included
configuration notecard. Resizing the Sticker Bubble makes no sense because it gets
resized by script, but maybe you want to change the bubble texture. The included scripts
are copy only. I suggest making a copy of the Sticker HUD and the Sticker Bubble before
you modify them, just in case.

CONFIG NOTECARD

Sticker packs and authorized users can be configured in a configuration notecard that
contains the word "StickerConfig" in its name. Comments start with "#", "//" or "--".
Several configuration lines can be combined on one line for faster reading by separating
them with "|". Sticker pack names must contain the dimension in their name, i.e. the
number of stickers in horizontal and vertical direction (see example). The same is true
when you put sticker pack textures in the HUD's inventory. Then you have to name your
texture e.g. "Legcat 7x6" to indicate that the pack contains 7x6 stickers.

  【秀】  [.Shuggles.] Mushrooms v1.48  【ツ】
============================================================

These are some simple mushrooms as result of my first experiments with creating sculpties
and meshes. Therefore I sell them for just a few bucks. Maybe you find them a nice way to
decorate your land. They are supposed to be rezzed on the ground, preferably in a forest
area.

The "Mushrooms" are sculpties and the "Meshrooms" are full meshes. Both are only 1 prim
at the sold size, but the latter require a mesh-compatible viewer. They are copy/mod/
no-trans, so you can modify them, e.g. to change their size. I suggest making a copy
before you modify them, just in case.

  【秀】  [.Shuggles.] Yuki-kun v1.48  【ツ】
============================================================

Yuki-kun was the first thing I build in SL on my second day, specifically Dec 3rd, 2006.
He therefore uses prims only and also doesn't contain scripts.

I want to share him mostly because of nostalgical reasons, but maybe you find him
a nice way to decorate your winterly land. He is supposed to be rezzed on the ground,
preferably on a snow-covered one.

He is copy/mod/no-trans, so you can modify him, e.g. to change his size. I suggest making
a copy before you modify him, just in case.

  【秀】  [.Shuggles.] Yuki-kun v2.48  【ツ】
============================================================

Yuki-kun v2 is a result of my first experiments with creating sculpties as some kind of
update to the prim-based Yuki-kun v1. Therefore I sell him for just a few bucks. He is
only 1 prim at any size and maybe you find him a nice way to decorate your winterly land.
He is supposed to be rezzed on the ground, preferably on a snow-covered one.

He is copy/mod/no-trans, so you can modify him, e.g. to change his size. I suggest making

Yuki-kun v3 is a result of my first experiments with creating sculpties and meshes as
some kind of update to the prim- and sculptie-based Yuki-kun v1 and v2. Therefore I sell
him for just a few bucks. The sculptie version is only 1 prim and the mesh version only
3 prims at the sold size. Maybe you find him a nice way to decorate your winterly land.
